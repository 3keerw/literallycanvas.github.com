About
=====

Literally Canvas is an extensible, open source (BSD-licensed), HTML5 drawing
widget. It depends on jQuery.

You can draw, erase, set the color with the eyedropper, undo, redo, pan, and
zoom. A semi-stable API allows you to add your own tools.

It's easy to get a data URL for upload to a site like Imgur or load/save a
user's drawing.

.. raw:: html

    <div class="literally"><canvas></canvas></div>

Why?
====

If you look at :ref:`related-projects` at the bottom of the page, you can see
that this isn't the only HTML5 drawing tool on the block. However, it is unique
in several ways:

* **It's open source.** Other drawing tools seem to be almost exclusively
  provided by businesses whose core feature is their drawing tool or
  freelancers who want you to pay them to adapt their work to your use case. We
  have nothing against those people, but it's important that free alternatives
  exist.

* **It's a widget, not an application.** Literally Canvas is intended to live
  inside your application in the way that works best for you. It doesn't take
  over your screen. It doesn't (intentionally) gobble up events. It tries to
  keep its UI to a minimum.

* **It wants to be extended.** We've tried to design it with extensibility in
  mind. There's no formal tool API, but if you have specific needs, we think
  it's easy enough to read the source and figure out how to add what you want.
  We hope to improve and expose the tool API in future releases.

* **It's fast and looks good.** Literally Canvas is optimized to work with
  complex drawings, and it smooths lines naturally to avoid the unsightly line
  angles often seen in simplistic drawing programs.

Literally Canvas was created in part to replace the object drawing tool in
`Buildy`_. We hope you're inspired to use it to make new things of your own!

Contributing
============

We would be excited to see contributions of any form. New brushes,
optimizations, feature requests, use cases, designs, bug reports â€“ you name it,
we want it! Just head on over to `GitHub`_ and get started.

One particular area where we'd like some help is in styling the toolbar. If
glitzy CSS-based UI is your thing, we'd love to hear your suggestions or merge
your pull requests.

feasible to implement without Flash, but there are several other projects with
