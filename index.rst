Literally Canvas
================

Literally Canvas is an extensible, open source (BSD-licensed), HTML5 drawing
widget. Its only dependency is `React.js`_.

.. _React.js: http://facebook.github.io/react/

.. raw:: html

    <div class="literally index"><canvas></canvas></div>

    <script>
      $(document).ready(function() {
        $('.literally.index').literallycanvas({
          backgroundColor: 'whiteSmoke'
        });
      });
    </script>

Literally Canvas's major features include:

* Basic drawing tools
* An API to add more drawing tools
* Panning and zooming
* Constant-size or infinite canvases
* Background images/shapes and watermarks
* Retina support
* Saving and loading JSON
* Events
* Exporting drawings to PNG

Why?
====

If you look at :ref:`related-projects` at the bottom of the page, you can see
that this isn't the only HTML5 drawing tool on the block. However, it is unique
in several ways:

* **It's open source.** It's developed by the community for many purposes and
  is free to use and extend.

* **It's a widget, not an application.** Literally Canvas is intended to live
  inside your application in the way that works best for you.

* **It wants to be extended.** There is a public API for adding new shapes and
  tools.

* **It's fast and looks good.** Literally Canvas is optimized to work with
  complex drawings, and it smooths lines naturally to avoid the unsightly line
  angles often seen in simplistic drawing programs.

Literally Canvas was created in part to replace the object drawing tool in
`Buildy`_. We hope you're inspired to use it to make new things of your own!
