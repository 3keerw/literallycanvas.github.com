About
=====

Literally Canvas is an extensible, open source (BSD-licensed), HTML5 drawing
widget. It depends on jQuery.

You can draw, erase, set the color with the eyedropper, undo, redo, pan, and
zoom. A semi-stable API allows you to add your own tools. It works great on
mobile devices.

It's easy to get a data URL for upload to a site like Imgur or load/save a
user's drawing.

.. raw:: html

    <div class="literally index"><canvas></canvas></div>

    <script>
      $(document).ready(function() {
        $('.literally.index').literallycanvas({
          backgroundColor: 'whiteSmoke',
          imageURLPrefix: '/_static/lib/img'
        });
      });
    </script>

Why?
====

If you look at :ref:`related-projects` at the bottom of the page, you can see
that this isn't the only HTML5 drawing tool on the block. However, it is unique
in several ways:

* **It's open source.** Other drawing tools seem to be almost exclusively
  provided by businesses whose core feature is their drawing tool or
  freelancers who want you to pay them to adapt their work to your use case.

* **It's a widget, not an application.** Literally Canvas is intended to live
  inside your application in the way that works best for you. It doesn't take
  over your screen. It doesn't (intentionally) gobble up events. It tries to
  keep its UI to a minimum.

* **It wants to be extended.** We've tried to design it with extensibility in
  mind. We hope to improve the tool API in future releases.

* **It's fast and looks good.** Literally Canvas is optimized to work with
  complex drawings, and it smooths lines naturally to avoid the unsightly line
  angles often seen in simplistic drawing programs.

Literally Canvas was created in part to replace the object drawing tool in
`Buildy`_. We hope you're inspired to use it to make new things of your own!

Browser compatibility
=====================

=========== ==============================
Chrome      Awesome
Safari      Awesome
iOS         Zoom is buggy
Firefox     23+ [#f1]_
Opera       ??
Android     ??
IE          10+ (Requires polyfill [#f2]_)
=========== ==============================

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] Works in previous versions, but the brush size slider will render
         as a text field.
.. [#f2] IE doesn't support the ``CustomEvent`` constructor. Use
         `Mozilla's polyfill`_ to get Literally Canvas to run in IE.
